# OSMP Manifesto

We believe the internet should empower individuals, not platforms.  
We believe AI should connect, not exploit.  
We believe producers and consumers deserve to meet directly, transparently, and fairly.

Open Source Market Project aims to:
- Remove intermediaries who distort prices and hide provenance
- Let small producers reach their market, wherever they are
- Use AI to assist, not dominate

This is infrastructure, not a startup.

# Open Source Market Project (OSMP)

**An open initiative to build a decentralized, transparent, and AI-powered marketplace connecting small producers and conscious consumers.**

## 🚀 Mission
To build an open source infrastructure where any producer can expose their products in a machine-readable format, and any consumer can find what they need — without going through centralized platforms like Amazon or Alibaba.

## 🧱 Components
- 🧑‍🌾 Producer-side assistant (IA-powered form → JSON product sheet)
- 🛒 Buyer-side simulator (compare APIs + open data)
- 📦 Product JSON format (universal and machine-friendly)
- 📜 Manifesto & Governance (open and fair)

## 📂 Structure
